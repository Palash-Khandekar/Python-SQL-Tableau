# Prediction of Absenteeism at Work
The aim of this project is to study the factors affecting the absenteeism of employee at work place and build a model to predict the absenteeism in hours. The data for this analysis is taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository. http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Absenteeism+at+work#
In this project, I have integrated Jupyter notebook, MySQL workbench and tableau to understand the flow of business in a real company.
